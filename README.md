This app gets the top HackerNews article (from https://news.ycombinator.com/best) once a day and writes a 500-word blog post about it using ChatGPT. The articles are stored in S3 and published on this Python web app.

**It has been *entirely* built by me chatting to ChatGPT (GPT-4) and copying and pasting responses into text files. I  did not write a single line of Python or HTML.**

It's running at https://chatgpt-chronicles.herokuapp.com. Records of the chats used to create it can be downloaded at https://chatgpt-chronicles.herokuapp.com/about.
