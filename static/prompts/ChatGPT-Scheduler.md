Write a script that calls another Python script every day

#### ChatGPT:
To call another Python script every day, you can use a combination of the `subprocess` module to run the script and the `schedule` module to set up daily execution. First, install the `schedule` module by running `pip install schedule` in your terminal.

Create a Python script named `main.py` with the following content:

```python
import subprocess
import schedule
import time

def call_script():
    script_path = "your_script.py"  # Replace with the path to your Python script
    subprocess.run(["python", script_path], check=True)

def main():
    schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(call_script)  # Set the time you want the script to run daily (e.g., "00:00" for midnight)

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(60)  # Check every minute if the scheduled job should be executed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run every day.

Now, run `main.py` in your terminal using the command `python main.py`. This script will call the specified Python script every day at the scheduled time (e.g., midnight). Make sure to keep the `main.py` script running for it to continuously execute the scheduled task.


#### You:
If I wanted to call the other Python script every minute, how would I do that?

#### ChatGPT:
To call the other Python script every minute, you can simply modify the scheduling line in the `main.py` script. Replace the line:

```python
schedule.every().day.at("00:00").do(call_script)
```

with:

```python
schedule.every(1).minutes.do(call_script)
```

The updated `main.py` script would look like this:

```python
import subprocess
import schedule
import time

def call_script():
    script_path = "your_script.py"  # Replace with the path to your Python script
    subprocess.run(["python", script_path], check=True)

def main():
    schedule.every(1).minutes.do(call_script)  # Set the script to run every minute

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)  # Check every second if the scheduled job should be executed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, run `main.py` in your terminal using the command `python main.py`. This script will call the specified Python script every minute. Make sure to keep the `main.py` script running for it to continuously execute the scheduled task.
