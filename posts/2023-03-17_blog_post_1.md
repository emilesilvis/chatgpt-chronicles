Docker's recent decision to start charging for organisation accounts has caused a lot of uproar in the open source community. Many maintainers are now scrambling to find alternatives to Docker Hub, as they cannot afford to pay the new fees.

GitHub Container Registry is one alternative that is gaining popularity, as it offers free storage for public images. However, GitHub is not without its own problems, as it has been plagued by outages and incidents in recent months.

Other alternatives to Docker Hub include GitLab and Quay. However, these registries are not without their own problems. For example, GitLab does not offer free storage for public images, and Quay is not as widely used as Docker Hub.

 Ultimately, the decision of which registry to use is up to the maintainer. However, it is important to be aware of the pros and cons of each option before making a decision.
